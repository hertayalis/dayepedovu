By default you don't need to supply a password to access the data, the key is just stored in the controller and everything is encrypted/decrypted on the fly. As with most SSDs with hardware encryption, if you set an ATA password you'll force the generation of a new key and that'll ensure no one gets access to your data.</description></item><item><title>Here's What Alberto Says to Luca at the End of 'Luca' (Hint: It's Adorable)</title><link>/what-does-alberto-say-to-luca-at-the-end.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-does-alberto-say-to-luca-at-the-end.html</guid><description>At the end of 'Luca,' Alberto says something in Italian to Luca — but what does he say?

A lack of water can account for jasmine’s failure to begin growing again. Drought and dry soil prevent the jasmine from starting a new season’s growth, leaving the plant dormant and looking dead. Regular watering helps bring the plant out of its dormancy.

If you don’t see any root rot, place the root ball back in the planter and cut down on the watering.</description></item><item><title> Jay Z has jeen-yuhs Kanye West to thank for some of his $1.3bn net worth Thu 17 February 202</title><link>/jay-z-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/jay-z-net-worth.html</guid><description>Ye, AKA Kanye West, is a world-renowned rapper, record producer and fashion designer.

He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow

He could preach the Bible like a preacher
